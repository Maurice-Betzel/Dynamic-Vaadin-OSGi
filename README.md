# Dynamic Vaadin on OSGi

Prerequisites: Java 8 and Maven 3.0.5

Download Apache Karaf 4.1.2, extract and startup

https://karaf.apache.org/download.html

Maven build ops4j-pax-web-6.0.7.1 available on this github and on the Karaf console execute:

    feature:repo-add mvn:org.ops4j.pax.web/pax-web-features/6.0.7.1/xml/features

And install the pax-http-whitboad extender:

    feature:install pax-http-whiteboard/6.0.7.1

Maven build this project root with mvn:install producing a Karaf Archive file (osgi-karaf-vaadin-kar-2.0.0.kar)

Drop this file into the deploy folder found under the Karaf main folder to install all needed bundles at once.

Open up a web browser and open http://localhost:8181/service to display the Vaadin SPA.

Start the dynamic bundle on the Karaf console to see the dynamic parts working.

Any new Ideas regarding this project are always welcome!
